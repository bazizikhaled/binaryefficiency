Patching is a method used to modify or extend software without altering the original source code. In the context of 
`sent`, patching allows you to customize its behavior, add new features, or fix issues while still being able to update 
the software.


1. **Download the Patch** : [`suckless sent patches`](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/patches)

2. **Apply the Patch**:

   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `sent` source code is located. Apply the patch using the 
   `patch` command:

{{< stylish-code height="1" size="17px">}}
patch -i [path_to_patch_file]
sudo cp config.def.h config.h
{{< /stylish-code >}}

   This command applies the changes specified in the patch file to the `sent` source code.

4. **Compile `sent`**:

   Recompile the modified `sent` source code to generate the patched executable:

{{< stylish-code height="0.5" size="20px">}}
sudo make install
{{< /stylish-code >}}
